# Track instructions — Sleep staging, Sleep-EDF

*Attach the dataset card (`sleep_edf_card.md`). Adapter: `sleep_edf.py`. **Reference track.***

> **Before you build — background & literature review.** Refresh the methods and do a short literature
> review of the application domain using **[`BACKGROUND_MAP.md`](BACKGROUND_MAP.md)** (the "Sleep
> staging" section): it lists the **book sections** that cover each method (a refresher — you already
> learned these), the **literature-review anchors** (dataset paper, AASM scoring standard, benchmark
> models), and the **guiding questions** your report must answer to *motivate* your design (course
> outcome **L5**).

## 1. The problem
From overnight PSG — **EEG + EOG + chin EMG** — assign a **sleep stage** (W / N1 / N2 / N3 / REM) to
every 30-second epoch, producing a hypnogram.

## 2. Your data (see the dataset card)
- Dataset: **Sleep-EDF Expanded** (ODC-BY, direct download via `mne` — **no agreement**).
- Signals: EEG Fpz-Cz + Pz-Oz, EOG, EMG; resampled to 100 Hz. Labels: 5 AASM stages (R&K→AASM merge).
- **Split unit (leakage): subject** — Sleep-Cassette has **two nights per subject**; splitting by night
  leaks subject identity. Never let a subject appear in train and test.
- Smoke subset: `SC4001, SC4011, SC4021`. Evaluation mode: **new-subject** (LOSO).

## 3. What you are given (do not rebuild these)
- The modular pipeline + a working baseline (`tracks.adapter.default_baseline`).
- The adapter (`sleep_edf.py`) with `smoke()`, an opt-in `preprocess()` (band-pass/notch — off by
  default, yours to choose), `extract_features()` (band power + Hjorth + entropy + EOG/EMG), and a
  Colab `download()/load()` that does the R&K→AASM merge and drops Movement/Unknown.
- The shared leakage-safe **evaluator** (`TrackAdapter.evaluate`, leave-one-subject-out).
- The **seven pipeline stages**, separable on the adapter (rubric Criterion 1): `download`/`load`/`smoke` → `preprocess()` → `extract_features()` → `select_features()` → `baseline()` → `infer()` → `report()`. Selection is fit **inside** every CV fold; `infer()` is the frozen, no-refit path used for `predictions.csv`.
- The **reporting module** (`report.py`): `summarize_results()` leads with the confusion matrix, then the primary metric **with its spread across subjects** — the shape §16.3 requires. `evaluate()` returns `per_group` / `per_fold` / `spread` / `summary` for exactly this.

## 4. What you must do (iterations)
1. **Run the baseline** on the smoke subset, then real nights; report the honest panel (κ, macro-F1, confusion).
2. **Improve the signal processing / features**: spindle detection (STFT/wavelet), better band-power
   estimation (multitaper), EOG/EMG artifact handling; consider cropping to lights-off ± 30 min.
3. **Improve the model / selection** (validated inside folds).
4. **Analyse failures** — N1 is the hard class; where do W↔N1↔N2 and N2↔N3 errors happen?

Each of those steps is a *menu*, not a march: the band you filter to, whether spindles come from an
STFT or a wavelet, whether artifacts are rejected / interpolated / flagged, whether you select features
at all — the scaffold ships options and their trade-offs (see `preprocess()` and `make_selector()` / `default_baseline()` in
`adapter.py`), and the grade is on the quality of your reasoning, not on matching one blessed recipe.

## 4b. Reporting (module 7) — what to show, and the code that draws it

```python
import report as R                       # tracks/report.py

rep = track.evaluate(X, y, groups)
track.report(rep)                        # confusion matrix first, then κ WITH its spread
R.plot_hypnogram(y_true_night, y_pred_night)          # predicted vs. reference, disagreements marked
R.compare_stage_summaries(y_true_night, y_pred_night) # TST, sleep efficiency, WASO, SOL, REM latency
```

- Lead with the **confusion matrix** and κ, never bare accuracy (§16.8).
- Quote κ **with its spread across subjects** — "mean κ 0.61 (range 0.34–0.73 across 8 subjects)" —
  because one hard sleeper is exactly what a pooled number hides.
- Show one **hypnogram**: a good per-epoch κ can still get the night's *shape* wrong.
- `compare_stage_summaries` states its own conventions (time in bed = the scored sequence, onset =
  first non-wake epoch); if your clinical definitions differ, use them and say which. With several
  nights, plotting the difference column against the mean gives you the Bland–Altman view of §16.5.

## 4c. The design-decision menus (stages 2-5) — what the scaffold offers, and the trade-off

Everything here is a **menu, not a recipe**. `tracks/adapter.py` ships each option *with its
trade-off* and no blessed answer; the rubric grades the reasoning (criteria 2 and 5), not the
choice. The notebook's "Decision points on this track" section runs several of them side by side
so you can watch the numbers move.

### Stage 2 — preprocessing · `cfg["preprocess"]`

`"none"` (default) · `"bandpass"` · `"wavelet"` · `"denoise"`. Setting `eeg_band`/`notch` alone still
turns the band-pass on, so older configs keep working.

**`"bandpass"` vs `"wavelet"` answer different noise signatures.** A fixed band is right for
*stationary, narrow-band* interference — 50 Hz hum sits in one place all night — but it is applied to
every instant equally, so it **smears the sharp transients**: K-complexes and spindle onsets are
brief broadband events and band-limiting rounds their edges. Wavelet thresholding asks instead which
*coefficients are too large to be noise*, localised in time as well as scale, so it removes movement
arousals and electrode pops (which live in no single band) while leaving the sharp K-complex edge
intact — at the cost of eroding **weak spindles** if the threshold is set too high.

### Stage 2 — preprocessing, **indexed by noise type** · `cfg["preprocess"] = "denoise"`

Chapter 8's rule is that you do not pick a filter, you **identify a corruption and then pick its
remedy** — §8.11: *"the noise's signature chooses the tool … not the reverse."* So
`adapter.denoise()` takes one key per problem, not one key per technique:

| Ch. 8 noise type | key | options | the trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| Impulsive / electrode pop (§8.7) | `impulsive` | `"median"` | the only remedy that works — a linear filter "lets the outlier vote" and smears the spike. A window longer than your narrowest feature flattens it |
| Baseline wander (§8.8) | `baseline` | `"highpass"` · `"detrend"` † · `"wavelet"` † | 0.5 Hz is fine for monitoring; a *diagnostic* ECG needs 0.05 Hz — too high a corner "can manufacture artificial ST shifts that mimic ischaemia". `"detrend"` avoids the corner but subtracts genuine slow trends too |
| Powerline (§8.6) | `powerline` | `"notch"` · `"adaptive"` · `"spectral"` † | `q` is the whole decision: too narrow misses a drifting hum, too wide bites real signal. `"adaptive"` (LMS) tracks drift; `"spectral"` avoids ringing but needs frequency resolution |
| Broadband / white (§8.4) | `broadband` | `"movavg"` · `"savgol"` · `"wavelet"` · `"gaussian"` | §8.4: "the only clean weapons against it are averaging and improving the acquisition hardware". `"savgol"` keeps peak height/width; `"wavelet"` keeps sharp transients best; neither rejects outliers |

**The order is fixed:** `impulsive → baseline → powerline → broadband`, because §9.7 requires that
"impulse removal must precede any linear filtering". Pass `broadband="median"` and the harness
moves it and tells you so.

> † `"detrend"`, `"wavelet"` (baseline) and `"spectral"` are **extensions beyond the book** —
> Ch. 8 names only high-pass/detrend, notch, median and averaging/adaptive. Use them if you can
> defend them, but cite something other than the book.

Two single-tool helpers sit underneath: `adapter.bandpass_notch()` (stationary narrow-band
interference) and `adapter.wavelet_denoise()` (non-stationary transients — motion, pops, drift —
removed *without* rounding off sharp landmarks the way a fixed band does). Full tables in their
docstrings.

### Stage 3 — spectral estimation · `cfg["spectral_method"]`, `cfg["ar_order"]`, `cfg["mt_bandwidth"]`

Every band-power feature is an integral under a **PSD**, and the PSD is an *estimate*, not a fact —
which estimator produced it has the same standing as the band edges (Chapter 7). `"periodogram"` ·
`"bartlett"` · `"welch"` (default) · `"multitaper"` · `"ar"` (Burg), via
`adapter.make_spectral_estimator` / `spectral_bandpower`.

§7.2 calls the raw periodogram **inconsistent**: more data buys more bins, not less scatter. §7.4
names the law the rest of the family obeys — *"This resolution-variance trade-off is the governing
law of non-parametric spectral estimation."* Welch is §7.16's "long, stationary record — the
workhorse"; **multitaper** averages orthogonal DPSS tapers over the *whole* record instead of
chopping it, so it is the better non-parametric choice on short segments "where Welch runs out of
segments to average"; **AR/Burg** gives a smooth, high-resolution spectrum from a short record but
carries §7.9's model-order risk — too low and real peaks merge, too high and the model sprouts
"spurious peaks that are not in the true spectrum", which your band powers will faithfully integrate.

§7.9's decision framework, worth quoting in your report: *"if you have a long, stationary record, use
non-parametric Welch — the everyday workhorse; if you have a short segment, use parametric AR (Burg
or Yule-Walker) for its resolution — and choose the order carefully."*

On this track it bites hardest because the bands are narrow (the book's own edges: delta 0.5-4,
theta 4-8, alpha 8-11, sigma 11-16, beta 16-30 Hz). Once the practical resolution coarsens past a
few Hz you are no longer measuring the band you named — alpha and sigma start reporting each other's
power. Only the five EEG band powers are recomputed; Hjorth, entropy, EOG and EMG are untouched, so
any metric change is the estimator's doing.

### Stage 4 — feature selection · `cfg["select"]`, `cfg["select_k"]`, `cfg["select_C"]`

`"none"` (default) · `"variance"` · `"anova"` · `"mutual_info"` · `"tree"` · **`"lasso"`**.

**`"lasso"`** is L1-penalised linear SVM selection: coefficients are driven to **exactly zero**, so
you get genuine sparsity and a short, defensible feature list. It is *embedded* like `"tree"` — both
see interactions a univariate filter cannot — but the two behave oppositely on correlated features.
A forest **splits the credit** between near-duplicates, so both survive; L1 **picks one and zeroes
the other**, because a second copy of an already-used feature buys no likelihood and costs penalty.
Trade-off: the sparsity is interpretable and cheap to report, but it assumes roughly **linear**
separability and is wrong when the real relationship is not; and because the winner inside each
correlated cluster is close to arbitrary, **check the surviving set is stable across folds** before
calling it "the" feature set. `select_C` is the strength (smaller C = fewer features) and it is a
number you must report. The harness prints how many features survived each fold, and falls back
loudly if the penalty erased them all.

### Stage 5 — class imbalance · `cfg["imbalance"]`, `cfg["threshold"]`

`"none"` · `"balanced"` (default) · `"balanced_subsample"` · `"resample"` · **`"smote"`** ·
**`"adasyn"`** · `"threshold"`.

**`"smote"`/`"adasyn"`** synthesise minority rows by **interpolating** between a real sample and one
of its k nearest minority neighbours, rather than duplicating exact rows (`"resample"`) or
reweighting the loss (`"balanced"`). The distinction to state in your report: `"balanced"` never adds
a row; `"resample"` adds exact copies, so the minority region gets heavier but not one millimetre
wider; `"smote"` adds **new points in feature space**, so the region genuinely expands and the
boundary is pushed rather than weighted.

That expansion is the whole benefit *and* the whole danger. A point halfway between two epochs is a
claim about feature space, **not about physiology** — interpolate between two different patients, or
between an N2 and an N3 epoch, and you have manufactured a body that does not exist. On these small,
heterogeneous cohorts that risk is live, not a footnote. If you use it, say what a synthetic minority
sample *means* on this track, and be honest if the answer is "nothing physiological".

Both are fold-safe (`adapter.SMOTEd` fits inside `fit` only, never at predict time) and both need the
optional `imbalanced-learn` package; every other option is sklearn-only. On tiny folds the
`k_neighbors` requirement is adapted downward automatically, and a minority class with fewer than two
members falls back to plain duplication with a loud warning rather than crashing mid-CV.

### Not a menu — the validation scheme

The leakage-safe split (LOSO / GroupKFold on this track's split unit) is **not** a design choice, and
there is deliberately no config key to turn it off. It is the only number that counts for your grade,
and `evaluate()` enforces it on every fold. The notebook's decision-points section contains a
**required one-time demonstration** that scores the data twice — a naive random stratified split and
the honest group-aware split — and prints the gap between them. Run it once, predict the gap first,
and record both numbers in `RESULTS.md`.

## 5. Deliverables
- A short **report** reading your κ against the **human ceiling (κ ≈ 0.76)** — a number *above* it is a
  red flag (Wake imbalance / tiny subset), not a win. Justify every design choice.
- `predictions.csv` (`record,epoch,label`) on the held-out split for hold-out evaluation.
- A cross-track showcase slot: "the same band-power/feature ideas, on EEG."
- A **results log**: copy `results_log_TEMPLATE.md` into your team repo as `RESULTS.md` and add one row per iteration — what changed and why, the metric **with its spread**, whether it beat the previous iteration (or why you kept it anyway), and the commit. **This file is graded** (rubric Criterion 9, 3 pts) and it asks specifically for at least one decision you went back and **revised because of a downstream result** — the notebook's "Decision points on this track" section has a symptom → stage table to diagnose from, and prints an A/B of several options so you can see the numbers move.

## 6. Rules
- Compare against the supplied baseline **honestly** — beating it is not required; a defended
  decision to keep a lower-scoring pipeline earns full marks (Criterion 7). State the **split
  unit (subject)** and evaluation mode with every number. Never report smoke/CI numbers as results. Report the metric **with its spread** across subjects (`rep["summary"]`), not a lone pooled number. Grading: [`CAPSTONE_REPORT_RUBRIC.md`](CAPSTONE_REPORT_RUBRIC.md) (team) + [`INDIVIDUAL_ASSESSMENT.md`](INDIVIDUAL_ASSESSMENT.md) (individual).

## 7. Known pitfalls
See the card: R&K→AASM merge (S3+S4→N3, drop Movement/Unknown), **split by subject not night**, Wake
dominates real recordings (accuracy is inflated — read κ), and N1 is rare and hard.
