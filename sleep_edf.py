        difficulty curriculum — deliberately NOT "easy".

        "easy" is strongly separable and every pipeline scores κ ≈ 1.00 on it,
        which makes every design decision on this track look free: change the
        band-pass, change the selector, change the classifier, the number does not
        move. That is the opposite of the lesson. "medium" adds subject gain
        shift, alpha-peak variability, pink/brown noise, baseline wander,
        artifacts and scorer label noise, so LOSO lands around κ ≈ 0.6 with a real
        per-subject spread — and choices start to *cost* or *earn* something you
        can measure. Pass `difficulty="easy"` if you want the old separable cohort

        heavier subject variability and noise (κ drops further, to roughly 0.2-0.3

        which is a floor to beat, not a recommendation.

        **Three supplied recipes, answering different noise signatures.** Pick one
        with `cfg["preprocess"]`:

            SleepEDFTrack(cfg={"preprocess": "none"})                  # default
            SleepEDFTrack(cfg={"preprocess": "bandpass", "eeg_band": (0.5, 40.0), "notch": 50.0})
            SleepEDFTrack(cfg={"preprocess": "wavelet",  "wavelet": "db4"})

                               "baseline": "highpass", "powerline": "notch"})

        (Setting `eeg_band` / `notch` alone still turns the band-pass on, as
        before, so older configs keep working.)

        `"denoise"` is the **per-noise-type menu** — Chapter 8's own structure,
        one key per corruption rather than one key per technique, applied in the
        order §8/§9 require (impulses → wander → mains → broadband). It is the
        right shape for this track because the synthetic cohort deliberately
        injects four *different* corruptions (`bsp.sleep_pipeline` adds electrode
        pops, flat-line dropout, clipping, baseline wander and 50 Hz hum), and a
        single band-pass is the correct answer to only one of them. Run §8.3's
        three-lens check on a few epochs, name what you actually see, then pick a
        remedy per problem — see `adapter.denoise.__doc__` for the full table.

        | `preprocess` | attacks | on THIS track that means | costs you |
        |---|---|---|---|
        | `"bandpass"` | **stationary, narrow-band** interference | 50 Hz mains hum sits in one place all night — a notch deletes it and nothing else; a 0.5-40 Hz band removes DC drift and EMG bleed | a fixed band is applied to every instant equally, so it **smears the sharp transients**: K-complexes and spindle onsets are brief broadband events, and band-limiting rounds their edges. Tighten to 0.5-30 Hz and you also delete the beta some Wake/N1 features lean on |
        | `"wavelet"` | **non-stationary transients** | movement arousals, electrode pops and slow baseline steps live in no single band, so no band-pass can remove them without taking signal too. DWT thresholding removes them where they *are* — localised in time and scale — and leaves the sharp K-complex edge intact | it shrinks everything, so too high a threshold erodes **weak spindles**, exactly the low-amplitude structure N2 depends on. Also a per-epoch threshold means neighbouring epochs are cleaned slightly differently |
        | `"none"` *(default)* | nothing | the honest floor to beat | the artifacts are still there, in every feature you compute |

        Both are supplied so the plumbing is not the exercise; the numbers (band
        edges, wavelet, threshold mode) are yours to choose and justify. Other
        defensible moves this stub does *not* make for you: re-referencing,
        EOG-informed artifact rejection vs. interpolation vs. keep-and-flag,
        cropping to lights-off ± 30 min (which changes the Wake prior, and
        therefore every metric). Record which you chose and why.

        Note: `bandpass_notch` is zero-phase (`filtfilt`) and therefore
        **non-causal** — correct here, because sleep scoring is retrospective and
        the whole night is on disk before anything is computed. See
        `adapter.bandpass_notch.__doc__` if you ever port this to a live monitor.

        This is the supplied starting set; spindle (sigma) detection via STFT or
        wavelets and per-subject normalisation are the obvious next moves, and
        choosing among them is the exercise.

        **The five EEG band powers are integrated from a PSD, and WHICH ESTIMATOR
        produced that PSD is a design decision** (Ch. 7), not an implementation
        detail. `bsp.epoch_features` uses `bsp.bandpower`, i.e. Welch — the
        book's "everyday workhorse". Override it:

            SleepEDFTrack(cfg={"spectral_method": "multitaper", "mt_bandwidth": 4.0})
            SleepEDFTrack(cfg={"spectral_method": "ar", "ar_order": 16})
            SleepEDFTrack(cfg={"spectral_method": "periodogram"})   # the naive baseline

        The menu and its trade-offs are on `adapter.make_spectral_estimator`.
        This track is where the decision bites hardest, for two reasons:

        * **The bands are narrow.** Sigma (the spindle band) is 11-16 Hz and
          alpha is 8-11 Hz. Every non-parametric estimator buys variance
          reduction by spending resolution, and once the practical resolution
          coarsens past a few Hz you are no longer measuring the band you named —
          alpha and sigma start reporting each other's power. §7.4's "governing
          law" is a concrete constraint here, not an abstraction.
        * **The epochs are short-ish and the classes hinge on weak rhythms.**
          A 30 s epoch at 100 Hz is 3000 samples; Welch with `nperseg=256` gets
          ~23 segments, which is comfortable. But a raw `"periodogram"` has ~100 %
          variance on every bin, so a genuine spindle and a noise excursion look
          alike — expect it to *lose* you kappa, and report that it did.
          `"multitaper"` gets Welch-like smoothing without chopping the record,
          and `"ar"` gives a smooth spectrum with a crisp peak — at the cost of
          §7.9's model-order risk (too low merges alpha and sigma into one hump;
          too high sprouts spurious peaks that your band powers will faithfully
          integrate).

        Predict which way each will move kappa *before* you run it, then check.
