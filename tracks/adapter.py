"""
tracks.adapter — the shared contract for every capstone track.

A "track" = a real public dataset + a small adapter. The adapter owns the
DOMAIN-SPECIFIC work (download, load, preprocessing, feature construction — i.e.
the signal processing the students do) and declares rich metadata (a dataset card
in code). The BASE owns the shared DISCIPLINE (subject-independent validation,
the honest metric panel, leakage guards) so every track is evaluated the same way.

THE SEVEN MODULES (book §16.2, rubric Criterion 1). Each is a separate, callable,
testable stage — never one opaque blob:

  | # | Stage           | Method                          | Who writes it |
  |---|-----------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
  | 1 | data loading    | `download()` / `load()` / `smoke()` | supplied  |
  | 2 | preprocessing   | `preprocess(rec, cfg)`          | **you**       |
  | 3 | feature extract | `extract_features(rec, cfg)`    | **you**       |
  | 4 | feature select  | `select_features(X, y, cfg)`    | **you** (options supplied) |
  | 5 | classification  | `baseline()` / your own `clf`   | **you**       |
  | 6 | inference       | `infer(model, rec, cfg)`        | supplied (frozen) |
  | 7 | reporting       | `report(rep)` -> `report.py`    | supplied + **your** reading |

`evaluate()` threads 2-5 together *inside every CV fold* (so selection and scaling
are never fit on test data, §16.2/Chapter 12); `infer()` is the separate,
train-free path that applies an already-fit pipeline to new data.

Design rules (from the review):
  * synthetic `smoke()` path so CI / offline / Colab-sanity always runs green;
  * a SUPPLIED baseline model — students improve it, never start from a blank page;
  * an explicit SPLIT_UNIT (the leakage unit) enforced on every fold;
  * metadata rich enough to render a dataset card automatically;
  * every result reported WITH ITS SPREAD across groups/folds, never a lone
    pooled number (§16.3 "definition of done", point 2).

NOTE ON CHOICE. This file supplies *options with trade-offs*, not one blessed
answer. `preprocess()` and `select_features()` default to pass-through so the
baseline runs; the alternatives (and when each is the better bet) are documented
on the stage itself. Picking one, and writing down why, is your job — and is what
the rubric's "design decisions are justified" line grades.

**BUT ONLY REAL CHOICES.** The six tracks do genuinely different amounts of
signal processing, so not every menu exists everywhere: Sleep-EDF and ECG run the
full Chapter 8 denoise menu and integrate band powers from a Chapter 7 estimator;
BCI has the spectral decision but an identity `preprocess()`; HAR has one
preprocessing knob (gravity) and no PSD-based feature; EMG and CTG have neither.
Each track therefore declares what it consumes in `SUPPORTED_CFG_KEYS` (on top of
`BASE_CFG_KEYS`, the stage-4/5 and CV keys the base class owns and every track
supports). Two consequences:

  * `tools/build_track_notebooks.py` renders only the menus a track really has,
    so a student is never offered an option with no consequence;
  * a cfg key the track never reads raises `UnsupportedCfgKey` instead of being
    silently ignored — a no-op wearing the costume of a design decision teaches
    the opposite of what these menus are for. Implemented a stub yourself?
    `track.declare_cfg_keys("csp_components", ...)` makes its knobs first-class.
    The check runs on **every** cfg resolution, so editing `track.cfg` in place
    after construction is caught too, not just the constructor argument.

**CONFIG PARITY BETWEEN TRAINING AND INFERENCE IS ENFORCED.** `train_baseline()`
records the resolved cfg on the `FittedModel` as an **immutable snapshot**;
`infer()` and `write_submission()` rebuild test features from *that* cfg when
none is passed, and a cfg you *do* pass is treated as a partial override of it —
the keys you name are applied on top of the training cfg, the rest keep their
training values, and only a named, feature-affecting key that genuinely differs
is refused. Predicting from a different pipeline than the one you validated is a
failure no metric in the report can reveal, because the report was computed on
the other pipeline.

    |-----------------|----------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
    | `"none"`        | —        | keeps everything  | few features vs. many samples; you want the model to arbitrate | irrelevant features dilute distance-based learners (k-NN, SVM) |
    | `"variance"`    | filter   | throwing away near-constant columns | cheap sanity pass before anything else | says nothing about relevance to `y` |
    | `"anova"`       | filter   | univariate F-test vs. the label | fast, stable, tiny folds | blind to feature *interactions*; assumes roughly linear separation per feature |
    | `"mutual_info"` | filter   | non-linear dependence with the label | non-monotonic relations (e.g. a band power good only in a middle range) | noisier estimate; needs more samples than ANOVA |
    | `"tree"`        | embedded | impurity importance from a forest | interactions matter; you already use trees | importance is biased toward high-cardinality/continuous features; correlated features share credit |
    | `"lasso"`       | embedded | L1-penalised linear SVM: coefficients driven to **exactly zero** | you want genuine sparsity and a short, defensible feature list; correlated-but-redundant features should be *eliminated*, not merely down-weighted | judges through a **linear** lens — wrong when the real relationship is non-linear, and among two correlated features L1 keeps one essentially arbitrarily |

    **`"tree"` vs `"lasso"` — the contrast worth understanding.** Both are
    *embedded*: the selection falls out of a model that saw all the features at
    once, so both can notice interactions a univariate filter is blind to. But
    they behave oppositely on correlated features. A forest **splits the credit**:
    two near-duplicate band powers each get roughly half the importance, so
    neither looks decisive and both survive a `"median"` threshold. L1 does the
    opposite — it **picks one and zeroes the other**, because a second copy of an
    already-used feature buys no extra likelihood and costs extra penalty. So
    `"tree"` gives you a ranking with redundancy intact; `"lasso"` gives you a
    genuinely short list, at the price of assuming roughly linear separability
    and of an arbitrary choice inside each correlated cluster (re-fit on another
    fold, it may keep the *other* one — check the stability before you claim the
    list is "the" feature set).

    `C` is the inverse L1 strength for `"lasso"` (`cfg["select_C"]`): smaller C =
    stronger penalty = fewer surviving features. It is a real knob, so report it.
    The L1 model is fit on **standardised** features inside the selector, because
    an L1 penalty is scale-dependent — without that, "selection" would just keep
    whatever features happen to be measured in large units.

    Trade-off in one line: filters are fast and stable but judge each feature
    alone; embedded methods see interactions but inherit the model's own biases.
    Whichever you pick, say in the report *why* — and show what it changed.

    """An OPTIONAL band-pass (+ optional mains notch) you can call from your own
    `preprocess()`. Supplied so the plumbing is not the exercise — the *choices*
    are: which band, what order, whether a notch is warranted at all.

    Trade-offs the book already made you meet (Ch. 8-10): a tighter band removes
    more noise but can amputate the signature you are about to measure (a 0.5-40 Hz
    EEG band keeps beta intact; 0.5-30 Hz would not); a higher order is a sharper
    edge but rings harder around transients; a 50/60 Hz notch is free when the hum
    is narrow-band and harmful when your feature lives near it. In §8.11's words,
    **"the noise's signature chooses the tool"** — so identify before you filter,
    and write down which signature you saw. `denoise()` in this module lays the
    same decision out as a menu indexed by noise type rather than by technique.

    ⚠️ **CAUSALITY — read this before you claim a real-time result.**
    The default (`causal=False`) uses `scipy.signal.filtfilt`, which filters the
    epoch forwards and then backwards. That is what makes it **zero-phase**: no
    group delay, no smeared landmark positions. It is also, unavoidably,
    **non-causal** — the output at sample *n* depends on samples *after* n, i.e.
    on the future. There is no way to run it on a sample as it arrives.

    * **Offline / retrospective analysis — which is what this entire scaffold
      does** (whole epochs are already on disk before anything is computed):
      `filtfilt` is the *right* tool, and staying with it is a defensible,
      reportable choice. It is not removed here and you are not expected to
      avoid it.
    * **A real-time / streaming deployment — the framing of the BCI motor-imagery
      and EMG gesture-control tracks**: a `filtfilt` pipeline is **not
      deployable as written**. A live BCI or a myoelectric prosthesis sees a
      sample stream, not a file. Reproducing these numbers on-line needs a
      **causal** filter — `scipy.signal.lfilter` with a single forward pass (and
      the group delay it costs you), a causal IIR design, or a short linear-phase
      FIR whose fixed delay fits your latency budget.

    Passing `causal=True` here switches to exactly that single forward
    `lfilter` pass, so you can *measure* what the honesty costs instead of
    asserting it: the phase distortion, the added latency, and the metric gap
    between the offline and the deployable pipeline. Reporting both numbers, and
    saying which one your deployment claim rests on, is worth marks; quoting an
    offline zero-phase number as if it were a real-time one is the same class of
    mistake as quoting a leaky split.

    genuinely different bet from `bandpass_notch()`. Multi-level DWT decomposition
    (`pywt.wavedec`) → thresholding of the detail coefficients → reconstruction
    (`pywt.waverec`), per channel, along the last (time) axis.

    **What it actually teaches (Ch. 5).** A fixed-band IIR filter makes one
    decision — *this frequency range survives, that one does not* — and applies it
    identically to every instant of the recording. That is exactly right when the
    interference is **narrow-band and stationary**: 50/60 Hz mains hum sits in one
    place all night, so a notch removes it and nothing else. It is exactly wrong
    when the interference is **broadband and transient**: a motion artifact, an
    electrode pop, a swallow, a baseline step. Those spread across the whole
    spectrum for a fraction of a second, so no band you can choose contains them —
    and the band you would have to remove takes the signal with it.

    Wavelet thresholding attacks the same problem in the other order. It asks not
    "which frequencies?" but "which *coefficients are too large to be noise*?",
    localised in time as well as scale. A sharp, brief, high-amplitude event keeps
    a few big coefficients and survives; low-level broadband noise is spread thinly
    across many small ones and is thresholded away. The practical consequence for
    these tracks:

    | | `bandpass_notch` (fixed-band IIR) | `wavelet_denoise` (DWT thresholding) |
    |---|---|---|
    | best against | **narrow-band, stationary** interference — 50/60 Hz hum, a defined out-of-band range | **non-stationary transients** — motion artifact, electrode pops, baseline drift/steps |
    | what it costs | rings around transients; a tight band can amputate the signature you came to measure | shrinks *everything*, so a too-high threshold erodes genuine low-amplitude structure |
    | effect on sharp morphology | a fixed band **blurs** the landmarks — an ECG **QRS** complex and an EMG action potential are broadband, brief events, so band-limiting rounds their edges and shifts their apparent width | preserves them: the sharp edge is carried by a few large fine-scale coefficients that survive thresholding |
    | effect on rhythmic content | preserves in-band rhythms exactly | can slightly attenuate genuine low-amplitude rhythms (weak sleep **spindles**, a shallow mu rhythm) |
    | the honest use | you can *name* the interfering band | you can see the artifact in the time series but cannot name a band that holds it |

    On Sleep-EDF that trade is live in both directions: **K-complexes and
    spindles** are precisely the sharp/short structures a hard band-pass smears,
    while over-aggressive thresholding is precisely what erases a weak spindle. On
    CinC-2017 ECG the **QRS** complex is the landmark every R–R and HRV feature
    depends on, and motion artifact is the dominant nuisance — the `~` class *is*
    the signal-quality class. Neither answer is free, which is why both are on the
    menu and neither is the default.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wavelet : str
        Mother wavelet (`"db4"` default — a common ECG/EEG choice; `"sym4"`,
        `"coif3"`, `"db6"` are equally defensible). The choice matters: a wavelet
        whose shape resembles the feature you care about needs fewer coefficients
        to represent it, so that feature survives thresholding better.
    level : int | None
        Decomposition depth. `None` = `pywt.dwt_max_level`, capped at 5 (deeper
        levels on a short epoch are dominated by boundary effects).
    threshold_mode : {"soft", "hard"}
        `"soft"` shrinks every coefficient toward zero (smoother output, slight
        amplitude bias); `"hard"` keeps or kills (preserves peak amplitude, can
        leave visible discontinuities). Say which you used.
    threshold : float | None
        `None` = the universal / VisuShrink rule, `σ·sqrt(2·ln N)` with σ robustly
        estimated per epoch from the finest detail band as `median(|cD1|)/0.6745`.
        Per-epoch estimation is deliberate: it is fit from the epoch's own noise
        floor and uses **no labels and no other recording**, so it cannot leak.
        Pass a number to override it — and then justify the number.
    channels : iterable | None
        Restrict to these channels; the rest pass through untouched.

    """**The stage-2 menu organised by NOISE TYPE rather than by technique** —
    Chapter 8's own structure. `bandpass_notch()` and `wavelet_denoise()` are
    single tools; this is the decision *table* they sit inside.

    Chapter 8's whole argument is that you do not choose a filter, you **identify
    a corruption and then choose its remedy**. §8.11's box is titled *"Identify
    before you filter"* and closes with the rule this function is shaped around:
    *"the noise's signature chooses the tool. Match a narrow, known-frequency
    artifact to a notch; low-frequency drift to a high-pass; broadband in-band
    noise to averaging or adaptive filtering; and impulsive outliers to a median —
    **not the reverse.**"* The chapter epigraph is blunter: *"Removing noise you
    have not identified is how you accidentally remove signal."*

    So the config is **one key per problem**, not one key per technique. Pick a
    remedy for each corruption you actually observed in your own data (run §8.3's
    three-lens check first — time, frequency, and what changes across epochs) and
    leave the rest off:

        track = ECGCinC2017Track(cfg={"impulsive": "median",
                                      "baseline":  "highpass",

                                      "broadband": "wavelet"})

    **Order is fixed and it is not arbitrary.** `impulsive → baseline →
    powerline → broadband`:

    1. **Impulses first**, because §9.7 is explicit that "impulse removal must
       precede any linear filtering" — a spike is broadband, so a notch or a
       band-pass cannot delete it, it "only smears the spike across a wide
       neighbourhood". Filter first and you have turned one bad sample into a
       hundred mediocre ones.
    2. **Then the slow trend**, which otherwise dominates every subsequent
       estimate and can saturate an adaptive filter.
    3. **Then the hum**, whose removal is cleanest on a de-trended signal.
    4. **Then whatever broadband residue is left.** Smoothing earlier would blur
       the transients you were trying to protect *and* leave the drift behind.

    ---
    ### 0 · Impulsive / outlier noise — `impulsive=` (§8.7: electrode pops,
    saturated samples, the 1-D twin of salt-and-pepper)

    | option | how it works | buys you | costs you |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | `"median"` | running median over `win` samples (`scipy.ndimage.median_filter`) | §8.7: impulsive outliers are "**not** removable by a linear (averaging) filter" — a mean filter "simply smears the outlier into a blur — **it lets the outlier vote**". "a lone extreme value cannot move a median, so the spike is rejected outright while edges are preserved" | non-linear, so its effect has no clean frequency-domain description, and a window longer than a feature flattens that feature outright. Choose `win` shorter than the narrowest thing you care about (on ECG: shorter than the QRS) |

    §8.2 adds the prior question: is this segment *noisy* or *broken*? "bad
    segments should be detected and excluded or flagged, **not silently
    filtered**" — filtering "quietly manufactures a plausible-looking trace out of
    garbage, and every downstream number inherits the fiction." A flatline or a
    railing electrode is a quality-control exclusion, not a median-filter job.

    ### 1 · Baseline wander — `baseline=` (§8.8: half-cell potential shifts, skin
    stretch, impedance change, cable movement; respiration drift near 0.15-0.3 Hz)

    | option | how it works | buys you | costs you |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | `"highpass"` | Butterworth high-pass at `hp_fc` (default 0.5 Hz) — **the book's own remedy** (§8.8, §8.16 table) | one line, well understood, exactly the right shape when the drift really is band-limited below the signal | §8.8: "the cutoff must be chosen with care, and the right value depends on the task. For **monitoring** (rhythm and heart-rate) a cutoff around 0.5 Hz is acceptable, but a **diagnostic** ECG must preserve content down to about **0.05 Hz**: too aggressive a high-pass distorts the low-frequency ST segment and T wave and **can manufacture artificial ST shifts that mimic ischaemia.**" The corner is a clinical decision wearing numerical clothes. A sharp filter also rings around the QRS |
    | `"detrend"` † | fit a low-order polynomial (`poly_order`, default 3) per epoch and subtract it | no filter: no phase response, no ringing, no corner frequency to defend. Handles drift that is *not* a clean band — a monotone ramp, a step-and-settle | the polynomial has no idea what is signal. A genuine slow physiological trend — a real FHR baseline shift, a slow tonic EMG rise — is fitted and subtracted along with the artifact. Raise the order and it starts eating the signal itself |
    | `"wavelet"` † | DWT, zero the coarsest **approximation** band, reconstruct | a wavelet-domain answer to the same problem: removes drift localised in time as well as slow, without committing to a single corner frequency | which scale counts as "baseline" depends on `fs` and the depth, so it is a corner frequency in disguise — just a less explicit one. Say which level you zeroed |

    ### 2 · Powerline interference — `powerline=` (§8.6: 50/60 Hz mains and its
    harmonics — narrow-band, near-stationary, usually strong)

    §8.6 calls this "**the *friendliest* artifact**: because it is narrow and its
    frequency is known in advance, a **notch filter** … removes it while barely
    touching the signal", and reminds you that "**Prevention helps too: good
    grounding, shielding, and twisted leads reduce pickup at the source, which is
    usually better than filtering after the fact.**"

    | option | how it works | buys you | costs you |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | `"notch"` | IIR notch at `f0` and `harmonics` (default 1st-3rd), quality factor `q` — **the book's remedy** (§8.6, built in §9.6) | simplest and cheapest; if the hum is stable and narrow this is genuinely all you need | **`q` is the whole decision.** Too narrow and it misses a hum whose frequency wobbles, and leaves the harmonics you did not list; too wide and it removes real signal beside 50 Hz — on EMG the 20-150 Hz band *is* the signal, so every notch is a real bite out of it |
    | `"adaptive"` | LMS cancellation against a synthesised sin/cos reference at each mains frequency (§10.5's method, applied here) | **tracks** amplitude, phase and small frequency drift, so it removes a wandering hum a fixed notch cannot; it subtracts only what correlates with the reference, so it is much gentler on nearby signal | §8.9's setup assumes a **real reference channel**; the synthesised reference used here is weaker. Needs `mu` tuned, converges over the first samples of each epoch, and can slowly adapt onto genuine signal that happens to correlate with the reference |
    | `"spectral"` † | rFFT, linearly interpolate across the offending bins, inverse transform | no time-domain filter at all: no ringing, no phase distortion, no edge transient. Surgical when the hum really occupies a few bins | needs **frequency resolution** — the bins must isolate the hum, so a short epoch cannot separate 50 Hz from its surroundings. And it assumes the hum is stationary across the whole epoch, which is exactly what `"adaptive"` does not assume |

    ### 3 · Broadband / in-band noise — `broadband=` (§8.4 white/thermal, §8.9
    EMG contamination of EEG)

    §8.4 is uncomfortably honest about the limit here: "Because white noise
    spreads its energy everywhere, some of it always overlaps the signal band and
    cannot be filtered out without touching the signal; **the only clean weapons
    against it are averaging (Chapter 7) and improving the acquisition
    hardware.**" Everything below is a compromise, not a cure.

    | option | how it works | buys you | costs you |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | `"movavg"` | boxcar moving average over `win` samples | the cheapest possible low-pass; unbiased for a locally constant signal | **blurs sharp features** — it lowers and widens a QRS peak — and its frequency response has large side-lobes, so it is a poor low-pass in the frequency domain too. §8.7: it "lets the outlier vote" |
    | `"savgol"` | Savitzky-Golay local polynomial least-squares (`win`, `savgol_order`) — §9.7's "smoothing that keeps the peak" | "**smooths broadband noise while largely preserving the height, width, and area of peaks** — the property a mean filter destroys — provided the window is kept **shorter than the peak** it must follow" | §9.7: "It is still a *linear* filter, so, like the mean, it does not reject true outliers — **pair it with a median pre-pass**" (which is what `impulsive="median"` gives you, and why it runs first) |
    | `"wavelet"` | DWT coefficient thresholding (`wavelet_denoise`) — §10.6's "wavelet denoising: exploiting sparsity" | §10.6's selection rule: use it "when the signal is *sparse/transient* and the noise is *broadband* (a single noisy ECG with no repetition and no reference)". Time-**and**-frequency localised, so it keeps the brief sharp transients (QRS, K-complexes, action potentials) that every fixed smoother rounds off | shrinks everything, so an over-set threshold erodes genuine low-amplitude structure such as a weak spindle; more parameters to defend |
    | `"gaussian"` | Gaussian-weighted smoothing (`win` ≈ 6σ) | smoother frequency response than a boxcar for the same width | same blurring bargain as `"movavg"`, same blindness to outliers |

    **The distinction this section exists to teach:** "noisy" is not one problem.
    Gaussian broadband noise and impulsive spike noise call for *different*
    remedies, and the linear tools that are correct for the first are actively
    wrong for the second — which is why they are separate keys here, and why the
    median runs first.

    ---
    † **Honesty note about provenance.** The options marked † are *extensions
    beyond the book*, offered because they are standard practice and make the
    trade-off richer: Chapter 8 names only high-pass/detrend for wander, notch for
    mains, median for impulses, and averaging/adaptive for broadband. Polynomial
    and wavelet baseline removal, and spectral interpolation of the mains bins, do
    not appear in the text. Use them if you can defend them — but cite something
    other than the book, and do not claim the chapter recommended them.

    ---
    Extra keyword arguments pass through to the individual remedies: `hp_fc`,
    `order`, `poly_order` (baseline); `f0`, `q`, `harmonics`, `mu` (powerline);
    `win`, `savgol_order`, `threshold_mode`, `level` (broadband and impulsive);
    `wavelet` and `causal` are shared. `channels` restricts the whole recipe to a
    subset of channels; the rest pass through untouched. `note` may be a callable
    (e.g. `self.note`) that the function uses to report re-ordering decisions.

    ⚠️ The filtered options are zero-phase (`filtfilt`) by default and therefore
    **non-causal** — right for the offline analysis this scaffold does, wrong for
    a live system. `causal=True` switches the IIR paths to a single forward
    `lfilter` pass. Note that `"detrend"`, `"spectral"` and `"wavelet"` are
    whole-epoch operations and are *inherently* non-causal whatever you pass,
    while `"median"` and `"adaptive"` are naturally causal-friendly. See
    `bandpass_notch.__doc__`.

    """Spectral-estimation stage (part of module 3) — **the PSD every band-power
    feature is integrated from.** Returns a callable `psd(x, fs) -> (freqs, pxx)`.

    Chapter 7's point is that "the PSD" is not a fact you look up; it is an
    **estimate**, and which estimator you used is a design decision with the same
    standing as the band edges. The raw periodogram is *inconsistent*: its
    variance does not shrink as you collect more data, so a longer recording buys
    you a longer, equally noisy spectrum. Every non-parametric method below is a
    different way of spending resolution to buy variance reduction; the parametric
    method buys resolution back by assuming a model.

    §7.2's word for the periodogram is **inconsistent**: "As N grows, we get
    *more frequency bins*, but the scatter around the true value at each bin
    **does not decrease**." A longer record buys finer bin spacing and no extra
    reliability. §7.4 then names the law every non-parametric method obeys:
    "Bartlett's method converts the useless variance of the periodogram into
    usable smoothness, paid for in resolution. **This resolution-variance
    trade-off is the governing law of non-parametric spectral estimation.**"

    | `kind` | Family | Variance | Resolution | Best when | Watch out |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | `"periodogram"` | non-parametric | high (**inconsistent**) | bin spacing ≈ 1/T | "never for features; a baseline" (§7.16) — include it to be *beaten* | variance stays ≈ the square of the true PSD at every bin **no matter how long the record**. A band power read off it is mostly estimation noise |
    | `"bartlett"` | non-parametric | ≈ 1/K | ≈ K/T (coarser) | long record, want simple averaging (§7.4) | averaging K segments cuts variance by ≈ 1/K, but each segment is N/K long so bin spacing *and* practical resolution coarsen by the same K. No taper, so **leakage** is untouched |
    | `"welch"` *(default)* | non-parametric | ≈ 1/K | tunable via `nperseg` | "long, stationary record — the workhorse" (§7.16); what `bsp.bandpower` already uses | §7.5: "Longer segments give finer resolution but fewer of them to average (higher variance); shorter segments give more averaging but coarser resolution. **You are always dialing along the same trade-off.**" Overlapping segments are not independent, so you get less variance reduction than the segment count suggests |
    | `"multitaper"` | non-parametric | ≈ 1/K, K ≈ 2NW−1 | full-record, set by NW | "short record, want low-leakage smooth PSD (EEG/neuro)" (§7.16) — a 4 s BCI trial or a 20 s ECG strip, where Welch **runs out of segments to average** | §7.6: it "trades a modest, *controllable* smearing (the half-bandwidth W) for a variance reduction". `bandwidth` (the time-bandwidth product NW, typically 3-4) sets resolution *and* how many tapers are usable — raise it to average more (lower variance, broader main lobe), lower it for sharper resolution. Most expensive to compute and to explain |
    | `"ar"` | **parametric** (Burg) | low, smooth | very high (sub-1/T) | "short segment, resonant rhythm" (§7.16) — a mu peak or an HRV peak you intend to *locate* | §7.9: "Choose it too low and the spectrum is over-smoothed — real peaks merge or vanish (**under-fitting**). Choose it too high and the model starts fitting noise, sprouting **spurious peaks** that are not in the true spectrum (**over-fitting**)." At p=40 on the book's EEG epoch the curve "breaks out in a rash of small peaks that are artifacts of over-fitting, not physiology" |

    §7.9's decision framework, which is the sentence to quote in your report:
    *"if you have a long, stationary record, use non-parametric Welch — the
    everyday workhorse; if you have a short segment, use parametric AR (Burg or
    Yule-Walker) for its resolution — and choose the order carefully."* Multitaper
    sits between them: non-parametric and assumption-light like Welch, but because
    it averages orthogonal tapers over the *whole* record it is often the better
    non-parametric choice on short segments.

    **Why `"ar"` here is Burg and not Yule-Walker.** §7.7: Burg "minimizes forward
    *and* backward prediction error directly on the data (never explicitly forming
    the autocorrelation), which gives it better resolution and more stable
    estimates on short records — **usually the best choice for biosignal epochs**."
    Order selection is yours: AIC = N·ln σ̂²_p + 2p, MDL = N·ln σ̂²_p + p·ln N, and
    §7.9's rule of thumb caps p at about N/3, "often far lower for a stationary
    epoch". `ar_order` defaults to 16, which is the value §7.9 shows working on a
    30 s EEG epoch — it is a *starting point you must justify*, not a constant.

    A concrete reason to care on these tracks: sleep band powers are integrated
    over bands only a few Hz wide (the book's own edges are delta 0.5-4, theta
    4-8, alpha 8-11, sigma/spindle 11-16, beta 16-30 Hz), so an estimator whose
    practical resolution has coarsened past a few Hz is no longer measuring the
    band you named — while an estimator with too much variance turns a real
    spindle into a coin flip. Both failure modes are invisible in the final
    metric unless you go and look.

    Note the §7.8 student-mistake this whole helper is built to avoid: band power
    is a density **integrated** over the band, ∫S(f)df — not a sum of raw FFT
    magnitudes. `spectral_bandpower()` below does the integration for you.

    Parameters mirror the book's: `nperseg`/`n_segments` for Welch and Bartlett,
    `bandwidth` (NW) and `n_tapers` for multitaper (`scipy.signal.windows.dpss`),
    `ar_order` for AR, `nfft` for the parametric frequency grid.

        There is no single correct recipe here, and the scaffold deliberately does
        not pick one for you. The usual candidates (Ch. 8-10), with what each buys
        and costs:

        * **band-pass** — keeps the frequency range your features live in; too
          narrow and you delete the signature you are about to measure.
        * **mains notch (50/60 Hz)** — cheap and effective for narrow-band hum;
          pointless (or harmful) if your band never reaches it.
        * **wavelet denoising** — thresholds DWT coefficients instead of bands, so
          it removes *non-stationary transients* (motion, pops, drift) that no
          fixed band contains, and does it without rounding off the sharp
          landmarks (QRS, K-complexes, action potentials) a band-pass blurs; the
          cost is that too aggressive a threshold erodes genuine low-amplitude
          structure such as a weak spindle.
        * **re-referencing / channel differencing** — cancels common-mode drift;
          changes what "the channel" means, so features are no longer comparable
          to un-re-referenced literature.
        * **artifact handling** — reject vs. interpolate vs. keep-and-flag. The
          first loses data, the second invents it, the third pushes the problem
          into the features. All three are defensible; say which and why.
        * **resampling / detrending / normalisation per recording** — helps
          cross-subject comparability, can erase amplitude information that
          actually carried the class.

        `bandpass_notch(rec, band=..., notch=...)` and
        `wavelet_denoise(rec, wavelet=..., threshold_mode=...)` in this module are
        ready-made implementations of the first three if you want them — you still
        choose the numbers, and the two are answers to *different* noise
        signatures (stationary narrow-band vs. non-stationary transient); see
        `wavelet_denoise.__doc__` for the side-by-side. Return a NEW `Recording`
        (see `Recording.replace_epochs`).

        ⚠️ **`bandpass_notch` defaults to `filtfilt` — zero-phase, and therefore
        NON-CAUSAL.** That is correct for the offline, whole-epoch analysis this
        scaffold performs, but it is not deployable in a live streaming system;
        `causal=True` switches to a single forward `lfilter` pass so you can
        measure the difference. This matters most on the two tracks with a
        real-time framing (BCI motor imagery, EMG gesture control) — see

        `bandpass_notch`, `wavelet_denoise` and every `denoise()` remedy are fixed
        transforms, or estimate their parameters from *one epoch's own samples*
        (the VisuShrink σ), and none of them looks at labels or at any other
        recording. A stateless transform commutes with the split: computing it
        before or inside the fold gives bit-identical features, so doing it once
        up front is a speed decision with no statistical content.

        **That safety does NOT extend to a transform that LEARNS from the data**,
        and the menus in this scaffold actively encourage you to try one:

        * a **CSP** spatial filter (the single strongest move on the BCI track),
        * **per-dataset / per-cohort normalisation** — a z-score whose mean and
          scale come from the pooled set rather than from one recording,
        * a PCA/ICA basis, a learned artifact template, a dictionary,
        * anything whose *fit* sees more than the one recording in front of it.

        Fit any of those here and every fold's "held-out" subjects have already
        contributed to the transform that built the training features. The
        leakage guard on the fold (`assert_no_subject_leak`) will still pass —
        it checks group ids, and it cannot see that a filter learned from them
        — so the number will look clean and be wrong.

        **The harness does not enforce this for you.** If you add a learned
        stage, do not put it here: fit it inside the fold. The two supported
        places are `select_features()` (which `evaluate()` already calls on the
        training fold only) and the classifier pipeline you pass as `clf=` (an

        ``cfg={"select": "lasso", "select_C": 0.1}``; see `make_selector` for the
        menu and the trade-offs. Override this method outright if you want
        something the menu does not offer (RFE, a CSP-style spatial filter, a
        domain-motivated hand-picked subset).

        The two **embedded** options ignore `select_k` entirely — `"tree"` cuts at
        an importance threshold and `"lasso"` keeps whatever L1 did not zero — so
        how many features survive is a *result*, not a setting. This method prints
        that count (and, for `"lasso"`, what to do if the penalty erased
        everything).

        **`select_k` is clamped to the track's feature count, out loud.** Four of
        the six tracks have fewer than the default `select_k = 20` features, so a
        naive `k=20` would silently keep everything and teach you that selection
        "does nothing". Instead of swallowing sklearn's warning, this method says
        so once — `note()` prints it and it lands in `rep["notes"]` — because a
        no-op you know about is a result and a no-op you don't is a bug.

        is deliberately a separate method from `evaluate()`'s training path so the

        **TRAIN → INFER CONFIG PARITY (this is enforced, not advised).**
        Preprocessing and feature extraction must run under the *same* cfg the
        model was fit under, or the classifier is handed a feature matrix from a
        different pipeline than the one it learned — a silent, invisible failure
        that no metric in the report can catch, because the report was computed
        on the *other* pipeline. `train_baseline()` therefore stores the resolved
        training cfg on the `FittedModel`, and this method:

        * **`cfg=None` (the normal case)** — resolves the cfg from `model.cfg`,
          i.e. exactly what the model was trained with. It does **not** fall back
          to the adapter's defaults, which is what used to make
          ``m = track.train_baseline(recs, cfg={"spectral_method": "ar"})``
          followed by ``track.infer(m, rec)`` quietly predict from Welch features.
        * **an explicit `cfg`** — is a *partial override of the training cfg*, not
          a fresh config: the keys you name are applied on top of `model.cfg`, and
          every key you omit keeps its training-time value (it does **not** fall
          back to the adapter's defaults). Only the keys you actually named are
          checked, and only the feature-affecting ones (`feature_cfg_keys()`) —
          so `cfg={"imbalance": "balanced"}` is never a conflict, while asking for
          a different `spectral_method` than the model was fit under raises
          `ValueError`. Pass `allow_cfg_mismatch=True` to acknowledge a deliberate
          mismatch (it is then recorded as a harness note, so it lands in the
          report rather than in nobody's memory).
        * **a model with no `.cfg`** (a bare sklearn estimator you fit yourself) —
          there is nothing to check against, so the adapter's own cfg is used and
          the parity guarantee is yours to keep.

    """**SMOTE / ADASYN synthetic over-sampling, applied inside `fit` only** — the
    same fold-safety contract as `OverSampled`, for the same reason: any
    resampling done before the split puts minority information on both sides of it
    and the resulting score is fiction.

    The difference from `OverSampled` is what gets added. Random over-sampling
    duplicates *exact rows* the model has already seen; SMOTE (Chawla et al.,
    2002) instead **interpolates**: it picks a minority sample, picks one of its
    k nearest minority neighbours, and creates a new point somewhere on the line
    between them. ADASYN does the same but concentrates the synthesis near the
    minority points that are hardest to classify (those with the most
    majority-class neighbours).

    ⚠️ **The biosignal-specific catch.** "A point on the line between two
    neighbours" is a statement about feature space, not about physiology. If the
    two neighbours are epochs from *different patients*, or an N2 epoch and an N3
    epoch that happen to be near each other, the synthetic vector is a hybrid that
    no body could have produced — a heart rate from one patient blended with an
    HRV spread from another, a spectral edge frequency that is not consistent with
    the band powers beside it. With the small, heterogeneous cohorts these tracks
    use (a handful of subjects, a few dozen minority rows), that risk is real and
    the "neighbours" can be genuinely dissimilar. Look at what it synthesises
    before you trust what it earns you.

    ⚠️ **SCALING HAPPENS FIRST, AND IT HAS TO.** "Nearest minority neighbour" is
    a statement about *distance*, and distance in raw biosignal feature space is
    dominated by whichever column happens to carry the largest units. A waveform
    length in the hundreds and a normalised spectral entropy in [0, 1] are not
    comparable magnitudes, so a k-NN search over unscaled features effectively
    ranks neighbours by the big column alone — and the synthetic minority rows
    get interpolated along an axis you never chose. That would quietly undo the
    entire point of offering SMOTE as a considered alternative to duplication.

    So this wrapper does **not** resample and then hand the result to the wrapped
    pipeline. It rebuilds the pipeline as `imblearn.pipeline.Pipeline` with the
    sampler inserted **after the wrapped pipeline's transformers and before its
    final estimator** — i.e. `StandardScaler → SMOTE → RandomForest` for the
    supplied baseline. Everything is still fit strictly inside `fit()`, so the
    fold-safety contract is unchanged: the scaler is fit on the training fold, the
    sampler sees only scaled training rows, and at predict time imblearn bypasses
    the sampler entirely (samplers are training-time-only steps). A practical
    consequence worth knowing: the resampling is now **invariant to the units of
    your features**, so re-scaling a column no longer silently changes which
    synthetic patients get invented.

    On very small folds SMOTE's `k_neighbors` requirement (the minority class must
    have more than k members) is adapted downward automatically, and if the
    minority class has fewer than two members in a fold — where interpolation is
    undefined — this falls back to plain duplication with a loud warning rather
    than crashing mid-CV.

    Inherits `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`, so `clone()`, `get_params(deep=True)`
    and nested `set_params(estimator__clf__max_depth=5)` reach into the wrapped
    pipeline properly (a shallow `set_params` would have created a top-level
    attribute literally named `"estimator__clf__max_depth"`, and every
    `GridSearchCV` candidate would have been the same model).

    """The SUPPLIED baseline every track inherits: a leakage-safe pipeline whose
    scaler is refit inside each CV fold. Students improve on this, never a blank
    page — and "improve" may mean a different learner, better features, or both;
    the scaffold does not decide which.

    **CLASS IMBALANCE IS A CHOICE YOU MUST REPORT, NOT A DEFAULT NOBODY SEES.**
    Four of the six tracks are imbalanced (CTG's pathological class, ECG's
    AF/Noisy, HAR's postures, sleep's N1), and the rubric explicitly grades
    *how* you addressed it. The shipped default is `"balanced"` (class-weighted
    loss) — not `"none"` — precisely so the baseline is not silently
    majority-biased; that means every measured baseline number already includes
    this choice, and reporting it (or trying `"none"` as your own controlled
    comparison) is part of the criterion, not optional. Pick with the config,
    e.g. ``cfg={"imbalance": "threshold", "threshold": 0.35}``:

    | `imbalance` | What it does | Good when | Watch out |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | `"none"` | plain majority vote; the classifier sees the prior as it is | the imbalance is mild, or the prior is *real* and you want calibrated probabilities | the minority class can be predicted almost never and accuracy still looks fine |
    | `"balanced"` *(default)* | per-class weights ∝ 1/frequency inside the loss | a quick, no-extra-data lever; the default so the scaffold is not silently majority-biased | it inflates minority influence uniformly — noisy minority rows get amplified too, and probabilities stop being calibrated |
    | `"balanced_subsample"` | as above, recomputed per tree (random forest only) | forests on strongly skewed data; slightly steadier than `"balanced"` | forest-specific; means nothing for an SVM or a k-NN |
    | `"resample"` | random over-sampling of the minority **inside `fit`** | you want the *decision boundary* moved, not just the loss reweighted | duplicated rows invite overfitting; done outside the fold it is a **leak** (this one is inside, on purpose) |
    | `"smote"` | **synthetic** minority over-sampling **inside `fit`**: new rows interpolated between a minority sample and one of its k nearest minority neighbours | duplication is over-fitting and re-weighting is too blunt; you want a *denser*, less repetitive minority region for the boundary to sit in | the interpolated vector is only physiologically plausible if the neighbours were — blending two **different patients**, or an N2 and an N3 epoch, manufactures a body that does not exist. On these small biosignal cohorts (a handful of subjects, a few dozen minority rows) that is a live risk, not a footnote |
    | `"adasyn"` | as `"smote"`, but synthesises more where the minority is hardest to classify | the minority is easy in one region and contested in another | it densifies exactly the boundary region, so mislabelled or artifactual minority rows get amplified the most |
    | `"threshold"` | keep the model, move the operating point on the minority class | recall matters more than precision and you can name the cost ratio | you must *report* the threshold — a tuned threshold chosen on test data is as dishonest as a leak |

    **`"resample"` vs `"smote"` vs `"balanced"` — the distinction to state in the
    report.** `"balanced"` never adds a row; it changes only how much each existing
    row *counts* in the loss. `"resample"` adds rows that are exact copies of rows
    already there, so the minority region gets heavier but not one millimetre
    wider — a tree can still isolate each duplicated point. `"smote"` adds rows
    that are **new points in feature space**, so the minority region genuinely
    expands and the boundary is pushed rather than merely weighted. That expansion
    is the whole benefit and the whole danger: SMOTE will happily interpolate
    between two dissimilar epochs and hand the classifier a hybrid feature vector
    no physiology produced. If you use it, say what a synthetic minority sample
    *means* on your track — and be honest if the answer is "nothing physiological".

    Both `"smote"` and `"adasyn"` are fitted **inside the CV fold only** (the
    `SMOTEd` wrapper), never at transform/predict time, for the same reason
    `"resample"` is: synthesising minority points before the split puts
    interpolations of the test rows into the training set. They need the optional
    `imbalanced-learn` package; every other option here is sklearn-only.

    They also resample **after** the pipeline's `StandardScaler`, not before it:
    the wrapper splices the sampler in as `scale → resample → clf` so that
    "k nearest minority neighbours" is a distance in standardised space. Search
    for neighbours in raw units and whichever feature happens to be measured in
    the largest numbers decides who gets interpolated with whom — see
    `SMOTEd.__doc__`.

    Trade-off in one line: weights and resampling change what the model *learns*;
    threshold-moving changes only what you *do* with it. Doing nothing is also a
    defensible answer — but then say in the report that you looked and why you
    left it. That sentence is worth marks; a silent default is worth none.
